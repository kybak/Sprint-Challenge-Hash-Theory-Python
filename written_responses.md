1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?
    A regular expression is a pattern used by a string searching algorithm to locate instances of a string pattern within a larger string set. There are multiple regex engines depending on the programming language but they all basically do the same thing--iterate over some given string and report if a match is found given the rules you provide. There are two types of regex engines: those based on Finite State Automation and those based on back-tracking. The former utilize state machines and are faster. The latter compile the pattern into byte-code jumping from instruction to instruction until it fails, at which point it back-tracks to find another way to match the input.
2. What is an array and how does it work?
    An array is a block of memory allocated to a list of elements, each identified by an index or key. The index represents an address pointing to some particular place in memory so that grabbing an element from an array by its index has a Big O of O(1). Arrays can be dynamic or fixed depending on the programming language. Dynamic arrays are still fixed but they resize as more elements are added. This comes with costs though. For instance, adding an element at the end of an array usually takes O(1) but if the array is dynamic and it doesn't have any room left it will need to resize, causing it to take O(n) time. Arrays can also be implemented as "associative arrays", also known as hash tables, which is a collection of key value pairs.   

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?
    A hash table is an associative array meaning it's an array consisting of key value pairs. The key is passed through some hash function which usually takes into account the total capacity of the array. The purpose of hashing the key is to provide an index for accessing its value in O(1) time. By hashing the index, it becomes a fixed size and easily searchable. Using the capacity of the array in the hash function ensures the index will always stay within the bounds of the array. By utilizing an hashed index we can grab some element by its key because the hashed index is pointing to some address in memory. Alternative we would have to iterate through an array until the value has been found. The problem with hashing functions is that they can cause collisions (two different keys can yield the same hash value). Solutions to this consist of resizing the array to reduce the chances of duplicate hash values or utilizing linked lists which stores multiple key value pairs under one hash value (though this can increase the time complexity).
